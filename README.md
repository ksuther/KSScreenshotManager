# KSScreenshotManager

Teach your computer to take screenshots of your app so you don't have to anymore. This project simplifies the process of creating automated screenshots of your iOS app. Some assembly is required, as you need to define your screenshots. Once you do that, this code will take care of the rest.

See this blog post for more details: <http://ksuther.com/2013/02/24/automating-ios-app-store-screenshots>

## Adding this to your project

1. Include KSScreenshotManager in your project. Adding it as a submodule is probably the easiest way to do this. Be sure to check out the WaxSim submodule as well by running `git submodule update --init`
1. Add `KSScreenshotManager.h`, `KSScreenshotManager.m`, `KSScreenshotAction.h`, `KSScreenshotAction.m` to your project
1. Subclass `KSScreenshotManager` and override `setupScreenshotActions`
1. Copy config.json.example and customize to suit your project

## Example project

An example project is located in Example (surprise!). It has a very simple KSScreenshotManager subclass named MyScreenshotManager. You can run it with the following command:

`python make_screenshots.py config.json.example`

This will compile the sample project, WaxSim, then use WaxSim to run the simulator build and dump the screenshots to /tmp/screenshots.

Make sure that you've checked out WaxSim as a submodule by running `git submodule update --init` after cloning this repository, otherwise `make_screenshots.py` won't work.
